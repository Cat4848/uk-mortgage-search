Hello everybody!  
Welcome to my UK Search Engine App.  

To create this App, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js and Axios.  

I also used an external API to draw the data from.  

How to use this app:  

* input your mortgage and property details;
* click on the button at the end of the page;
* the app will then show you the mortgage products available to you based on your input.

Enjoy!
